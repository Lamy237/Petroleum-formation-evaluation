## Objective
To determine the formation water resistivity (Rw) using the inverse Archie method.


## Theory
**HLS Asia Limited**, Log Interpretation Seminar/ Workshop, (14th â€“ 16th May 2007, New Delhi), 4-6, 2007.

The inverse-Archie method of determining Rw works under the assumption that water saturation (Sw ) is 100%. It is necessary, therefore, that the inverse-Archie 
method be employed in a zone that is obviously wet. Furthermore, it is desirable to calculate Rw from the inverse-Archie method in a clean formation with relatively 
high porosity.

$ R_{wa} = \frac {phi^m * R_t} {a} $

Once a clean and porous wet zone is located, lithological assumptions must be made about that formation in order to select the appropriate values of cementation 
exponent (m) and tortuosity factor (a) to use in the equation. This estimate should be accomplished by quick-look means using a combination of the gamma ray, 
porosity, and Pe curves. Formation water resistivity calculated by the inverse- Archie method (Rwa) depends upon lithology; however, Rwa calculated in one lithology 
can be used for water saturation (Sw ) calculations in a zone of different lithology. For example, Rwa may be determined in a sandstone, and this value may then be 
used in the Archie equation to calculate water saturation (Sw ) in a limestone, provided that the necessary temperature corrections have been made. This is one of 
the many assumptions that must be made in log analysis applications.
